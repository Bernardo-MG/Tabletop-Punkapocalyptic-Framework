## Tabletop's Punkapocalyptic Framework library
Punkapocalyptic's Framework library for the Tabletop project.

### Version
The project is still under development, so expect a certain degree of instability. Class paths and names may change, and classes keep receiving enhancements which make them change with frequency.

## Building
The application was coded using Java, and dependencies are handled through Maven.

### JDK
Coded with JDK 7.

### Dependencies
All dependencies are handled through Maven, and noted on the pom file.

But currently my projects lack a Maven repository, and so can't be handled automatically by this application.
